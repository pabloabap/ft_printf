This project take printf as reference and build some of its functionalities from scratch to understand how variadic
functions work.

> The final file of this project when `make` is an archive **libftprintf.a**.

Functionalities implemented:

- **%i** Print integer number (base 10).
- **%u** Print unsigned decimal (base 10).
